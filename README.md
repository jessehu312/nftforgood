## Inspiration
Digital assets have been on the rise lately, cryptocurrency and artwork have gathered a large audience. Given the newness of the space there is a lack of platforms that allow users to safely purchase digital assets and also supports charitable causes for those in need. By tying these two key needs together we hope to unlock great potential, creating a platform that allows NFT collectors and NFT artists to work hand in hand to create a better environment for our world.

## What it does
Thatâ€™s where **NFT4Good** comes in, NFT4Good is an online marketplace for NFTs that benefits charitable causes and enables NFT artists to convert their creativity into meaningful action. We hope to bring mainstream adoption of NFT world and make our mark by leveraging it to support charities! This will open up a whole new opportunity for blockchain charity projects, fundraising models, and hopefully make the world move one step closer to being an even better place.

So how does our platform work?
1. An Artist produces digital artwork.
2. Artwork then gets authenticated by NFT.
3. Limited number of artwork becomes available through auction.
4. Portion of the auction goes to charities of their choice.
5. Winner of the auction gets the digital artwork.
6. Besides, they will also get good coins every time they bid on an item, that's exchangeable with AI-generated artwork.
